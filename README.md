# pi-sensor-dashboard

The goal of this project is to make an easy to use web dashboard for various sensors connected to a Raspberry Pi that includes live sensor data, controls, and graphs.

This project is in development and has not had a release.  

The current list of planned sensors available for the first release:
 - DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
 - Analog Sensors Via MCP3008/MCP3004/MCP3002
 - Distance sensors HC-SR04 and JSN-SR04T
 - PIR Motion Sensor
 - File/command based 'sensors' (IE CPU Usage)

***Feel free to recomend other sensors.***

Planned Feature list:
 - Live readings
 - Software controlled buttons/switches
 - Database storage of readings
 - Pi Sensor networking (multiple Pis collecting data)
 - Graphing
 - Data conversion tools
 - Customizable Dashboard
 - Events, timers and notifications
